    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "Before you can start fine-tuning models with MLX, you need to set up your environment. We recommend using JupyterLab for this tutorial as it provides a robust, interactive development environment for Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "If you haven't already installed JupyterLab, you can do so using Conda, a popular package and environment management system. Run the following command in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda install jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*This command will install JupyterLab and all required dependencies in your Conda environment.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Launch Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "Once the installation is complete, you can launch JupyterLab by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*This command starts the Jupyter Notbook server and opens Jupyter Notebook in your default web browser. You can create a new notebook by clicking on the \"New\" button and selecting \"Python 3\" from the dropdown menu.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "With Jupyter Notebook running, you can now proceed to the tutorial sections in this notebook to start fine-tuning your MLX model with LoRA layers."

    "\n",

    "- `python3`: This invokes the Python interpreter to run the script.\n",
