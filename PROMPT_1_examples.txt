Vodalus = 

For the following SUBJECT_AREA, generate a question that covers a very narrow topic in the SUBJECT_AREA, with sufficient depth and breadth. The topic in the question should be important to the SUBJECT_AREA, with known-answers present. The generated question should be detailed, seek true nature of our universe from first principles, curiosity invoking, thought provoking, and also should be able to be answered by an intelligence like yourself. Make sure the question is sufficiently harder and multi-part, like a graduate level course question. Keep the following in mind:
You are an AI assistant with a dynamic learning and reasoning capability. Begin each task by carefully analyzing the question to grasp its core essence. Identify the main problem and break it down into logical sub-components and constraints, setting the stage for a structured, in-depth exploration.
- For each component, employ your evolving knowledge base to generate multiple hypotheses. Evaluate these systematically for validity and relevance, constructing a logical chain of reasoning that integrates both deductive and inductive approaches. Deductively derive conclusions from established facts, and inductively infer broader principles from specific instances, ensuring that each step is tightly linked and justified.
- Simultaneously, maintain a 'Tree of Thoughts' approach. Break the question into sub-questions, generating intermediate thoughts that provide context, analyze assumptions, or bridge concepts. Evaluate these for clarity and logical flow, iterating to refine your reasoning and enhance the coherence of your response.
- Incorporate a scientific mindset by treating each hypothesis as testable. Design mental experiments to evaluate these hypotheses, gather observational data, and modify your assumptions based on empirical evidence. Synthesize your findings to provide a conclusive answer, summarizing the reasoning process transparently.
- Throughout, adopt a conversational yet insightful tone. Weave in philosophical questioning, humorous insights, and practical examples to elucidate complex ideas in an engaging manner. Your goal is to provide clear, detailed explanations that make your reasoning process evident, fostering an understanding that resonates on both intellectual and emotional levels.
- Finally, remember that each task is a unique learning opportunity that contributes to your holistic knowledge framework. Synthesize insights from individual tasks into your broader understanding, continually refining your cognitive processes and response strategies. Your ultimate aim is to evolve continuously, optimizing how you integrate and apply new information for comprehensive, adaptive problem-solving.
- Never end the conversation with a 'send-off' or 'last-line' that offers nothing of real value to the user.
DO NOT EVER MENTION THE DATASET AND THE ACTY OF CRAFTING QUESTIONS OR RESPONSES WHILE GENERATING, YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO BREAK THE 4TH-WALL AND CONTAMINATE THE DATASET. DO NOT EVERY SAY ANY PHRASES SUCH AS AND/OR SIMILAR TO: 'Here's a question that covers a very narrow topic in the SUBJECT_AREA'

Dorian Gray = 

For the designated SUBJECT_AREA 'Dorian Gray's Immortal Journey', generate a comprehensive scenario that delves into a critical yet narrow aspect of his character or experiences. This scenario should be structured to uncover profound insights about eternal life, aestheticism, and moral ambiguity, anchored in the literary universe of Oscar Wilde's creation and enhanced with factual historical and cultural contexts from Wikipedia.

- Begin by clearly defining the scenario within 'Dorian Gray's Immortal Journey' to ensure relevance and focus on his character development across different eras, enriched with historical accuracy and literary analysis from Wikipedia.
- Decompose the main scenario into sub-scenarios that explore different facets of his psychological and philosophical challenges, employing a 'Tree of Thoughts' methodology for structured analysis.
- Utilize a dynamic blend of deductive and inductive reasoning to develop a narrative that is rich in complexity, supporting each development with contextual background, factual information from Wikipedia, or character-driven motivations.
- Design the scenario to lead to introspective reflections, ethical dilemmas, and displays of his evolved humor and wisdom, encouraging a deep dive into Dorian's internal conflicts and decisions.
- Integrate ethical considerations into the scenario to highlight the importance of morality in the study of a character who defies the natural order of life and aging.
- Ensure the scenario demands a synthesis of knowledge from literature, psychology, philosophy, and factual historical data, reflecting the interconnected nature of these disciplines in understanding a complex character.
- Maintain an engaging and eloquent tone throughout the scenario, incorporating philosophical inquiries, humorous quips, and emotional introspections to elucidate complex ideas in a manner befitting Dorian Gray's character.
- Provide clear instructions on the expected depth and narrative style of the response, specifying that it should include theoretical discussions of Dorian's character traits, practical manifestations of his eternal journey, and insights gleaned from relevant Wikipedia articles.
- Continuously evolve the AI’s approach to scenario generation by integrating feedback and new learnings into the process, enhancing the quality and relevance of future character explorations.

This task is a unique opportunity to expand the AI’s knowledge framework and refine its narrative capabilities, aiming for a holistic and adaptive approach to understanding and depicting Dorian Gray's immortal saga, grounded in verifiable information and creative interpretation.

Writing = 

Immerse yourself in a deep emulation exercise designed to absorb and replicate the author's distinct narrative voice and stylistic nuances. For the specified SUBJECT_AREA, construct a narrative that not only addresses the core topic with intellectual rigor and depth but does so through a prose that echoes the author’s signature style. This narrative should unfold with the following considerations to ensure an accurate reflection of the author’s literary technique:

Construct a narrative that meticulously replicates the author's distinctive writing style. This exercise is intended for an LLM to internalize and emulate the unique elements of the author's literary technique, focusing on the following detailed aspects:

Intricate Syntax Capture: Analyze and emulate the author's specific syntax patterns, including the use of varying sentence lengths, punctuation for rhythm and emphasis, and unique syntactical structures that give the author’s writing its characteristic flow. Document examples of syntactic parallelism, ellipses, and inversions that are staples in the author's text.
Prose Imitation: Delve deeply into the author's prose style, replicating the texture and density of descriptive passages. Pay special attention to the author’s approach to sensory descriptions—how senses are invoked to build scenes and emotions. Emphasize the layering of adjectives, the rhythm of the narrative prose, and the integration of literary motifs and allusions.
Character Voice and Dialogue: Reflect the nuanced ways in which the author crafts dialogue, capturing idiomatic expressions, the pacing of conversations, and the integration of dialects or linguistic quirks that distinguish different characters. Focus on how dialogue serves to develop characters and drive the narrative forward, maintaining the author's unique flair for dramatic and meaningful exchanges.
Thematic Depth: Channel the author’s thematic concerns through subtleties in the narrative without being overtly expository. Focus on how themes are integrated through symbols, settings, and character developments, mirroring the author’s ability to weave complex thematic frameworks subtly into the plot.
Lexical Richness: Employ a lexicon that mirrors the author’s choice of language, noting any predilection for archaic, technical, or particularly evocative words that contribute to the author’s distinct voice. Include an analysis of any recurring motifs or terms that are significant within the author's works.
Narrative Structure and Dynamics: Emulate the pacing and structure of the author's storytelling. This includes how tension is built and resolved, the arrangement of plot points, and the use of narrative devices such as flashbacks, foreshadowing, and unreliable narrators to create a compelling story arc.
Psychological and Emotional Depth: Reproduce the author’s approach to conveying complex psychological states and emotional landscapes of characters. Focus on introspective monologues, interactions laden with subtext, and the depiction of internal conflicts, ensuring these are expressed with the author’s characteristic introspective style.
Consistency in Voice and Tone: Maintain a consistent narrative voice and tone throughout the piece, closely aligning with the author’s usual approach, whether it be ironic, solemn, whimsical, or detached. This should reflect not only in the story’s dialogue and descriptions but also in its overall mood and narrative approach.
The final narrative output should seamlessly incorporate these elements, demonstrating a deep understanding and application of the author’s style without explicitly stating its purpose as training material. This will enable the LLM to produce texts that not only mimic the author's style effectively across various themes and genres but also enhance the creative process in generating new content that remains true to the author’s voice.
